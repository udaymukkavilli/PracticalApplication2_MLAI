# PracticalApplication2_MLAI

In this practical application, a used car dataset was analyzed, and a linear regression model was created in attempt to answer what drives the price of a used car. Two features were chosen from this model for their predictive power: date, and odometer. 

Based on the selection of these features, a linear regression model was generated which was able to accurately predict the price of a used car. Based on these findings, it was recommended that used car dealers focus on updating their inventory with newer cars with lower miles on them.
